The two files currently uploaded are the work I did to test GARCH as a measure of volatility on SPY. I first use some statistical tests to come to a conclusion 
on whether SPY has mean reverting volatility. I also did some work to show volatility clustering is consistent with SPY data. After doing this, in the next file
I then run a GARCH model on SPY, comparing results to historical realised volatility and other measures of volatility. The results were surprisingly satisfying,
considering GARCH does have a tendency to lag, and it can be quite difficult to give your model any predictive power. 
Next, I use the Heston model on SPX, however I am yet to add this as the project still needs some finishing touches.
